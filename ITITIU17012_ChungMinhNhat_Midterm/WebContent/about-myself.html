              <p> My name is <b> Chung Minh Nhat </b>, a sophomore at <i>Ho Chi Minh City International University - Vietnam National University</i>. I came to this university in the year of 2017, receiving the Student ID of <b>ITITIU17012</b>, and is expecting to graduate in 2021 with a degree of <i>Bachelor of Engineering</i> in <b>Computer Science</b>. </p>
            <h1> Ho Chi Minh City International University </h1>
              <p> I believe that HCMIU is one of the best universities of the nation. I found out about this university one day on television, as I was in awe seeing the shown Intelligent Traï¬ƒc System project. The contract was won by the university's Rector at the time, the Associate Professor, Dr. Ho Thanh Phong along the university's research teams. Their produced something very extraordinary: they gave computers human-like eyes. With so-called Computer Vision, machinaries were about to act on their own via visual signals to aid humans. The Computer Vision & Image Processing (CVIP) lab gave the demo that drove me to Ho Chi Minh City International University, motivating me at the path of technology for human assistance. </p>
            <h1> Study interests </h1>
              <p> With a view to becoming more fluent at manipulating at the details of software along its components, I major in <b>Computer Science</b> and have been a part of the CVIP lab since my freshman year.</p>
              <p> I have become much more involved in <i>Data Structure & Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Computer Vision</i>, training myself to utilize useful technologies that can assist or replace humans in practical pursuits by providing less cost. </p>
            <h1> Extracurricular </h1>
              <p> Outside of school hours, I enjoy hanging out with family and friends, and reading. By favorite book is "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" written to biographically remark the fascinating life of Professor Feynman - the famous Theoretical Physicist of Caltech. </p>
              <p> I also enjoy sports, some of which I also competed in that include Taekwondo, Athletics, Football and Basketball.</p>
